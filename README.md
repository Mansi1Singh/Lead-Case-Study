Lead Scoring Case Study

Industry professionals can purchase online courses from X Education, an education firm. Many experts who are interested in the courses visit their website and look through the offerings on any given day.
The business advertises its classes via a number of websites and search engines, including Google. Upon accessing the website, these individuals may peruse the available courses, complete the course registration form, or view some videos. These folks are categorised as leads when they complete a form with their phone number or email address. Additionally, the business receives leads from previous recommendations. After obtaining these leads, sales team members begin calling, emailing, and so on. Some of the leads convert during this process, but the majority do not. At X education, the lead conversion rate is typically 30%.
Few leads emerge from the bottom as paying clients, despite the fact that many are created in the first stage (top). To increase lead conversion in the intermediate stage, you must properly nurture your potential leads (i.e., educate them about the product, stay in continual communication, etc.).
You have been assigned by X Education to assist them in identifying the most promising prospects—that is, the leads with the highest likelihood of becoming paying clients. 
According to the company's requirements, you must create a model in which you give each lead a score, meaning that clients with higher lead scores are more likely to convert than those with lower scores. The intended lead conversion rate, as stated by the CEO in particular, is approximately 80%.

•	Our Case Study's Objectives:
To create a logistic regression model that will allow the business to target potential leads by giving each lead a score between 0 and 100.
You will also need to take care of things in order to adapt in case the company's requirements change in the future.
The steps are broadly:
1.	Examine and comprehend the information
2.	Clear the information
3.	Get the data ready for building the model.
4.	Construction of Models
5.	Assessment of the Model
6.	Forecasting Using the Test Set
•	Summary
In summary, a large number of leads are created at the top stage, but only a small percentage of those leads convert to paying customers at the bottom level. To achieve a greater lead conversion rate in the middle stage, you must properly nurture the potential leads (i.e., educating the leads about the product, connecting with them frequently, etc.).
Sort the most promising leads from the leads you have created first. The factors that have the biggest impact on the likelihood that a lead will convert are "Total Visits," "Total Time Spent on Website," and "Page Views Per Visit."
After that, you need to have a list of leads on hand so you can tell them about upcoming higher education opportunities, new services, and job offers. Keep a close eye on every lead so you can customise the content you give them. Give careful consideration to job offers, information, or courses that best fit the interests of the leads. To effectively capture leads as prospects, a well-designed plan that maps out each lead's demands will be essential.
Consider converted leads first. Have Q&A meetings with leads to get the crucial details you require about them. Set up follow-up meetings and questions with the leads to find out if they intend to enrol in online courses and how they feel about it.
